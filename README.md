# finalproject2015

I have been thinking about collective experiences and representation. I have been photographing Hunan for two years, but only from a single prospective: a series of photographs, taken by one person and one camera, that has a narrative potential. In dialogue with my senior thesis project, the final project for this class would be a series of small interactive segments. I hope to create a poetic online project, and one of them would present a series of photographs I made using iPhone during the winter in a disperse way, emphasizing the flatness and looseness of digital images. Hopefully two question sections that allow the audience to enter "questions for Hunan/what do I want to know about Hunan" and "questions for America/what do I want to know about America", which are the most frequently asked question for me while traveling.
